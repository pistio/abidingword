//! The native API the frontend calls through Tauri's `invoke`.
//!
//! Commands are thin: they take typed input, call a repository function in
//! `crate::db`, and return typed output or an [`ErrorPayload`]. No SQL
//! crosses this boundary. The only file paths the frontend sends are the
//! files the user picked in the system's open dialog to import a Bible.
//!
//! Commands are marked `async` so database work runs off the window's main
//! thread and never freezes the interface.
