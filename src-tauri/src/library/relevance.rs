//! How well a source's passage link fits the passage being read.
//!
//! Pure functions over verse-key ranges (`BBCCCVVV`, see `scripture::reference`),
//! so the order of the Sources pane is a rule that can be read and tested, not an
//! accident of a query. Deterministic: no text similarity, no scoring model.
//!
//! Two questions decide where a place goes, and the first matters most.
//!
//! **1. Is the text *about* the passage, or does it only *cite* it?**
//! (the [`Evidence`])
//!
//! - *About*: a manual link; a section whose heading names the passage; a
//!   citation inside a section whose heading is about the passage.
//! - *Neutral*: a citation in text with no passage-bearing heading around it.
//! - *Cross-reference*: a citation inside a section whose heading names a
//!   **different** passage ("Cross-references for Matthew 13:23" citing John
//!   15:5). The citation is real and stays indexed; as a suggestion for John 15:5
//!   it is incidental.
//!
//! **2. How specific is the link to the passage?** (the [`Fit`]) A link to
//! exactly the passage, or a short range containing it (John 15:1–11 for John
//! 15:5), is specific. A whole chapter is broader, two or three chapters wider,
//! and four or more (John 11–21, a whole Gospel) is too broad to suggest anything:
//! it is kept, but last. This counts chapters spanned, not raw verse-key distance
//! (a chapter's end is verse 999, which only has to order sizes).
//!
//! Together they give the **class** (smaller is better):
//!
//! | class | what |
//! |---|---|
//! | 0 | a manual link (not too broad) |
//! | 1 | about, and exact or narrow: a section on John 15:1–11 for John 15:5 |
//! | 2 | about, but a whole chapter or only partly overlapping |
//! | 3 | a neutral citation, exact or narrow |
//! | 4 | wider or neutral-but-broad: two or three chapters, a neutral chapter |
//! | 5 | a cross-reference |
//! | 6 | far too broad (four or more chapters), whatever the evidence |
//!
//! Within a class: the origin (manual, section heading, mention), then the fit
//! (exact before narrow …), then the link whose size is nearest to the passage.
//!
//! A place that shares no verse with the passage does not match, even in the same
//! chapter: the pane prefers precision to recall, so nothing is invented from a
//! shared chapter number.
//!
//! The source type (book, sermon, notes …) is deliberately not a factor.
