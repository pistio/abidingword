//! Presentation & Delivery (v0.18): how one Bible Teaching is delivered.
//! The teaching stays the source of truth; a presentation only says which of
//! its parts are shown, in which order, and what the audience sees apart
//! from what only the speaker sees. The TypeScript mirror is
//! `src/types/presentation.ts`; details in docs/presentation-delivery-v0.18.md.

/// * `quote`: a quotation, with who said it;
