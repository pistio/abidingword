//! Study and research help (v0.20): one way of asking for the Bible Study,
//! a library source and a comparison of sources.
//!
//! The person's own words stay the person's. What the assistant returns is
//! kept apart from them, in a temporary panel, until the person accepts a
//! piece of it. The pipeline is the same for every kind of help:
//!
//! 1. **Context** ([`study`], [`source`], [`compare`]): numbered, labelled
//!    blocks assembled deterministically from the database, within fixed
//!    limits. Scripture (P), the person's writing (W), their notes (N),
//!    quotations kept in notes (Q), library passages (S) and the request (R).
//!    Nothing else: never another study, the rest of the library, settings,
//!    keys or file paths.
//! 2. **Preview** ([`preview`]): every block, word for word, the service and
//!    whether text leaves the computer. Its fingerprint covers exactly what
//!    would be sent.
//! 3. **Ask** ([`run`]): the request is assembled again; it is sent only when
//!    its fingerprint is the one the person saw. Nothing holds the database
//!    while waiting.
//! 4. **Check** ([`interpret`]): every quotation in the answer is looked for
//!    in the block it names; one that is not there is dropped. A claim about
//!    what a text or an author says without such a quotation is shown as the
//!    assistant's inference. Places in a source come from the source's stored
//!    text, never from the answer.
//! 5. **Keep** ([`keep`]): a note in the study, only from words the person
//!    accepted, marked with the assistant's name, citing the source passages
//!    it rests on (checked against the stored text again).
